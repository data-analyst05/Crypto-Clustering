# Crypto Clustering

## Project Overview

The Crypto Clustering project is an exploration of cryptocurrency market data with the aim of clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns. This project utilizes data analytics techniques, normalization, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and K-Means clustering to gain insights into the cryptocurrency market.

## Project Description

Cryptocurrencies have gained immense popularity in recent years, and their price volatility is a subject of great interest. This project analyzes cryptocurrency market data to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns. The key steps in this project include:

1. **Data Loading**: The project starts by loading cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file.

2. **Data Normalization**: The data is normalized using the `StandardScaler` module from scikit-learn, making it suitable for clustering.

3. **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means clustering is applied to the normalized data to group cryptocurrencies into clusters. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.

4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, reducing the data to three principal components.

5. **Clustering on PCA Data**: K-Means clustering is again applied to the PCA-transformed data.

6. **Visualization and Comparison**: The results of clustering are visualized using scatter plots, allowing for easy comparison of clusters.

This project serves as a demonstration of data analytics techniques and provides valuable insights into the cryptocurrency market.
